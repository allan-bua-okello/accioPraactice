        CSS SELECTORS
        ``````````````
        Selectors are used to select html elements
        selector{
            property : value;
            property : value
        }
        Note:{} - this is the declaration block

        types of selectors
        1. Universal selector
        this is represented by * and it represents the whole page of the html file for example
        *{
            background color: red;
        }

        2. Type selector/tag selector
        h1{
            color : blue;
        }
        3. Class selector
        we use . to access the class
        .name{
            color: orange;
        }
        4. ID selector
        we use # to access the id element
        #{
            padding : 10px
            width : 100px
        }
        5. Atribute seelector
        [type="text"]{
            background: black;
        }

        diff btn id and class
        id is unique in that it can only be used on 1 element while a class can be used on multiple elements
